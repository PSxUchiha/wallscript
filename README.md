Simple Shell script to change plasma wallpaper, meant to run as cron job, the plasma shell script can be created as a variable with arguments, will improve later(soon).

Edit: improved, now the shell script accepts arguments and uses python backend to select the wall based on date variable, code is more flexible now.

Create a wall directory in same folder as the script for it to work.
